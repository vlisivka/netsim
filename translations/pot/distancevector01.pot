"In <strong>dynamic</strong> routing, routers build their routing tables "
"based on the knowledge they have about neighbor's links. Those links now "
"have a <strong>cost</strong>, reflecting a measure of distance/bandwidth/"
"delay between nodes. In <strong>distance vector</strong> algorithms, the "
"router algorithm is basically <em>tell your neighbors when you know about "
"everyone</em>."

"In this level, three routers automatically exchange their distance vector "
"tables and build their routing tables this way. The topleft router is manual "
"and disabled when the simulation starts. Leave it disabled and first observe "
"how routers exchange information and build their tables, and also when they "
"decide to stop."

"Next reload (F5) the simulation (to destroy router's tables, not done yet) "
"and activate the manual router. Start by filling its Distance Vector table "
"with its 2 neighbors (Charlie and Router 1), and then you will have to reply "
"to the successive packets sent by others routers by updating your DV table. "
"Building the routing table and sending packets is done automatically when "
"you update the DV table."

"<em>Tip:</em> to update the DV table, you must add new device entries coming "
"from other routers (adding the link cost to other router costs) or modify "
"the existing entries if their new cost (other cost + link cost) is less than "
"your current cost."
