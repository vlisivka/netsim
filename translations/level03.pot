"So far we have seen very basic packets. These packets have shown only the "
"source (who sent the packet) and the destination (who received the packet). "
"In this level, we will see a more complex packet that will give the "

"Pause the simulation to view the packet sent from Alice's computer to "
"Google. There is a new header under the <strong>transport layer</strong>. "
"The header, <strong>proto</strong> defines the <strong>protocol</strong> "
"that will be run on this layer. The protocol listed is <strong>ICMP</"
"strong>, which is used to <strong>ping</strong> computers. When a computer "
"receives a packet with an ICMP echo request (ping) they respond by sending "
"back a packet with an ICMP echo (pong). Resume the simulation and notice the "
"response packet sent from Google to Alice's computer."
