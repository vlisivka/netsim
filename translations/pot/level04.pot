"Computers are usually not connected directly, but are accessible through a "
"series of <strong>routers</strong>. A router operates much like a postal "
"office. When it receives a <strong>packet</strong>, it looks at the "
"destination and determines which route to send it on. They usually choose "
"the route that is closest to the destination computer. They keep track of "
"all their routes in a <strong>routing table</strong>."

"srcip and dstip headers we saw in the earlier levels. There is no extra "
"information to tell the routers how to send the packet. Instead, this "
"information is stored in the router's routing table."
