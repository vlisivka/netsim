"The srcip and dstip headers can be easily changed to specify different "
"source and destination addresses. In the previous levels, we saw that "
"changing the destination address changed the direction in which the packet "
"was sent. Note, however, that we did not need to specify a source address. "
"In fact, routers do not take into account where a packet is coming from, "
"only where it is going. One security flaw of the Internet is that we can "
"easily make a packet <strong>look</strong> like it is coming from one "
"address when it is really coming from another. This is called "
"<strong>spoofing</strong>."
