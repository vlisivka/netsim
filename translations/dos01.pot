"A <strong>Denial of Service (DoS)</strong> attack overwhelms a computer or "
"server by flooding it with <strong>packets</strong>. The purpose of "
"<strong>DoS</strong> attacks are to make a system (such as Google) "
"unavailable for others to use. This often distracts the administrators of "
"the system and allows an attacker to exploit it in different ways and remain "
"unnoticed."
