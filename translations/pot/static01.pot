"In previous levels, we saw that computers are usually connected through a "
"series of <strong>routers</strong>. When a router receives a <strong>packet</"
"strong>, it looks at the destination in the dstip header of the packet, and "
"chooses the route that is closest to the destination computer using a "
"<strong>routing table</strong>. The route is given by a <strong>port number</"
"strong> in this table, a router port being connected to a particular "
"<strong>link</strong> in the network."

"Pause the simulation and look at each router. You are now able to see and "
"edit their routing tables. These are made of rules (one rule per line in the "
"table), each rule associates a destination address <code>dstip</code> to a "
"router port number <code>portNum</code>. Also use connector icon on links to "
"visualize the port numbers where links are connected on the routers."

"In this level, we just add Charlie's computer and its router <code>Router 4</"
"code> with an almost empty routing table. Try to send a packet from Charlie "
"to Carol and observe the response made by <code>Router 4</code>. In the same "
"way you may try to send a packet from Carol to Charlie."

"To pass this level, you have to edit the routing tables to send a ping "
"packet from Charlie's computer to Carol's computer. Remember that ping "
"packets are those with proto header set to ICMP. To edit the routing tables, "
"use the add rule icon near the table header, or use the delete icon near a "
"particular rule to delete that rule. Manually editing the routing tables is "
"known as <strong>Static routing</strong>."
